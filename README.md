# Kora Documentation

[Kora](https://github.com/kora-projects/kora) is a framework for writing Java / Kotlin applications with a focus on Performance, Efficiency, Transparency.
Kora aims to provide sufficiently high-level declarative tools and abstractions for developers,
which are converted at compile time into hardware-performing and human-readable code.
